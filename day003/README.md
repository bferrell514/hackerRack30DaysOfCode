Obj<b>Objective</b><br> 
In this challenge, we're getting started with conditional statements. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

<b>Task</b><br>
Given an integer, , perform the following conditional actions:<br>

<ul>
<li>If  is odd, print Weird</li><br>
<li>If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Not Weird</li><br>
<li>If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Weird</li><br>
<li>If  is even and greater than , print Not Weird</li><br>
<li>Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not  is weird.</li><br>

<b>Input Format</b><br>
A single line containing a positive integer, .<br>

<b>Constraints</b><br>
1 <= <i>n</i>

<b>Output Format</b><br>
Print Weird if the number is weird; otherwise, print Not Weird.

<b>Sample Input 0</b><br>
3

<b>Sample Output 0</b><br>
Weird

<b>Sample Input 1</b><br>
24

<b>Sample Output 1</b><br>

Not Weird

<b>Explanation</b><br>

<b>Sample Case 0: n = 3</b><br>
n is odd and odd numbers are weird, so we print Weird.

<b>Sample Case 1: n = 24</b> <br>
n > 20 and  is even, so it isn't weird. Thus, we print Not Weird.
