<b>Objective</b><br> 
In this challenge, we're going to use loops to help us do some simple math. Check out the Tutorial tab to learn more.<br>

<b>Task</b><br>
Given an integer n print its first 10 multiples. Each multiple n x i (where 1 <= i <= 10) should be printed on a new line in the form: n x i = result<br>

<b>Input Format</b><br>
A single integer, <i>n</i>.

<b>Constraints</b><br>
2 <= <i>n</i> <= 20<br>

<b>Output Format</b><br>
Print 10 lines of output; each line  (where 1 <= <i>i</i> 10) contains the result of n x i in the form: n x i = result.<br>

<b>Output Format</b><br>
Input is handled for you by the stub code in the editor.<br>

The first line contains an integer, T(the number of test cases), and the T subsequent lines each contain an integer denoting the age of a Person instance.<br>

<b>Output Format</b><br>
Complete the method definitions provided in the editor so they meet the specifications outlined above; the code to test your work is already in the editor. If your methods are implemented correctly, each test case will print 2 or 3 lines (depending on whether or not a valid initialAge was passed to the constructor).

<b>Sample Input</b><br>
2<br>


<b>Sample Output</b><br>
2 x 1 = 2<br>
2 x 2 = 4<br>
2 x 3 = 6<br>
2 x 4 = 8<br>
2 x 5 = 10<br>
2 x 6 = 12<br>
2 x 7 = 14<br>
2 x 8 = 16<br>
2 x 9 = 18<br>
2 x 10 = 20<br>
